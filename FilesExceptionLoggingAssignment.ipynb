        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "  - The key difference between Interpreted and Compiled languages lies in **how they are executed**:\n",
        "    - Interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. This means the code doesn't need to be converted into machine code beforehand, making debugging and modification easier but often leading to slower execution speeds. Example: Python, Javascript, Ruby etc.\n",
        "    - Compiled languages on the other hand are translated entirely into machine code before execution using a compiler. This results in **faster execution** since the program is already converted (machine/byte code) into a format that computer understands. However, debugging is usually harder because errors are caught only after compilation. Example include C, C++ and Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows programs to gracefully deal with runtime errors and unexpected situations. It prevents abrupt termination and provides a structured way to handle errors and notify users or log it for troubleshooting.\n",
        "  - How It Works:\n",
        "      - Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions:\n",
        "      - **try Block:** Contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "      - **except Block:** Defines how to handle specific exceptions if they occur.\n",
        "      - **else Block:**  Runs if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
        "      - **finally Block:** Runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "```\n",
        "      try:\n",
        "          num = int(input(\"Enter the first number: ))'''\n",
        "          num1 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: ))\n",
        "          result = num1 / num2  #may cause error if num1 is 0\n",
        "          print(\"Result: \",result)\n",
        "      execpt ZeroDivisionError as ze:\n",
        "          print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
        "      else:\n",
        "          print(\"No errors occurred during divison.\")\n",
        "      finally:\n",
        "          print(\"Program execution completed.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "  - The **finally** block in Python's exception handling is guaranteed to execute regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. Its primary purpose is to define cleanup actions that should always be performed, like closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database.\n",
        "  - Key Features of finally\n",
        "    - Runs no matter what, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "    - Ensures proper cleanup (closing files, network connections, etc.).\n",
        "    - Works alongside try-except blocks to maintain code reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "    - Logging in Python is a built-in module that helps track events that occur during a program's execution. It's useful for debugging, monitoring, and recording errors without cluttering your output with unnecessary print statements.\n",
        "    - Use of Logging:\n",
        "      - Helps identify bugs and unexpected behavior in programs.\n",
        "      - Records program execution without disrupting functionality.\n",
        "      - Supports different logging levels for better control.\n",
        "      - Can write logs to files, consoles, or external systems.\n",
        "    - Basic Logging Setup\n",
        "      - Python provides a logging module, which can be used as follows:\n",
        "```\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.info)\n",
        "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message that will not be logged due to logging level\")\n",
        "logging.info(\"This is an info message.\")\n",
        "logging.warning(\"This is a warning.\")\n",
        "logging.error(\"This is an error.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Output in app.log file.\n",
        "#note the Debug message is missing due to logging level above info level only.\n",
        "INFO:root:This is an info message.\n",
        "WARNING:root:This is a warning.\n",
        "ERROR:root:This is an error.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging levels hierarchy:\n",
        "\n",
        "|Logging Level (Order of severity of message)|Description|\n",
        "|:--------------------------------:|:---------:|\n",
        "| DEBUG   | Detailed diagnostic information for debugging (Least severe) |\n",
        "| INFO    | General messages showing program execution |\n",
        "| WARNING | Indicates potential issues |\n",
        "| ERROR   | Logs errors that prevent normal execution |\n",
        "| CRITICAL | Logs severe errors causing program failure (Most severe)|\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Hence when the 'level' in basicConfig is given as level=logging.info,\n",
        "    all messages with levels including and above in severity order will be\n",
        "    logged, hence 'DEBUG' messages will not be logged.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "  - The ***```__del__```*** method in Python is a special *destructor* method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. Its primary purpose is to free up resources, close connections, or perform cleanup tasks before an object is removed from memory by the garbage collector.\n",
        "  -  eg:\n",
        "```\n",
        "class FileManager:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "        self.file = open(filename, \"w\")\n",
        "        print(f\"Opened {filename}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        self.file.close()\n",
        "        print(\"File closed!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Creating an object\n",
        "    fm = FileManager(\"example.txt\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Deleting the object manually\n",
        "    del fm  # Calls __del__ method\n",
        "\n",
        "    #Output\n",
        "    Opened example.txt\n",
        "    File closed!\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - Even if you don’t manually delete the object, Python’s garbage collector will eventually free memory and call ```__del__```.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "  - The difference between import and from ... import in Python lies in how modules and functions are accessed.\n",
        "    1. ```import module```\n",
        "    - Imports the entire module.\n",
        "    - Requires you to reference functions or variables using ```module.function()```.\n",
        "    - Useful for keeping namespaces clean and avoiding conflicts\n",
        "```\n",
        "    import math\n",
        "    print(math.sqrt(16))  # Access sqrt via math module\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. ```from module import function```\n",
        "    - Imports a specific function or variable from a module.\n",
        "    - Allows direct usage without referencing the module name.\n",
        "    - Can lead to name conflicts if multiple modules have similar function names\n",
        "```\n",
        "    from math import sqrt\n",
        "    print(sqrt(16))  # Directly using sqrt without \"math.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "  - Handling multiple exceptions in Python allows you to manage different types of errors efficiently within a try block. There are three main approaches to handling multiple exceptions:\n",
        "  - 1. Using Multiple except Blocks\n",
        "  You can handle different exceptions separately by defining multiple ```except``` blocks. order must be first specific exceptions and then generic exception.\n",
        "```\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "          num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # May raise ValueError\n",
        "          result = 10 / num  # May raise ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "    except ValueError:\n",
        "          print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
        "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "          print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")  \n",
        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "          print(\"Generic exception that is not handled above.\")  \n",
        "```\n",
        "  - 2. Handling Multiple exceptions in one ```except``` block using tuple.\n",
        "```\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "          num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "          result = 10 / num\n",
        "    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n",
        "          print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - 3. Catching All exceptions ```Exception```  block as generic exception.\n",
        "```\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "          num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "          result = 10 / num\n",
        "    except Exception as e:\n",
        "          print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "  - The with statement in Python is used for automatic resource management, particularly when working with files. It ensures that resources like file streams are properly closed after use, preventing potential issues like memory leaks or file corruption.\n",
        "    - Why Use with for File Handling?\n",
        "      - Automatic Cleanup: Closes the file automatically when the block exits.\n",
        "      - Prevents Resource Leaks: Avoids accidentally leaving files open.\n",
        "      - Improves Code Readability: Removes the need for manual file closing\n",
        "```\n",
        "      #Instead of\n",
        "      file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
        "      data = file.read()\n",
        "      file.close()  # Manual closing required\n",
        "\n",
        "          #Best practice usage\n",
        "      with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "          data = file.read()\n",
        "          print(data)  # No need to manually close the file\n",
        "```\n",
        "  \n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "|Feature|Multithreading|Multiprocessing|\n",
        "|:------:|:------------:|:-------------:|\n",
        "|**Execution Model**|Multiple threads within the same process|Multiple independent processes|\n",
        "| **Parallelism Type** | Concurrent execution (not true parallelism due to GIL) | True parallelism (each process gets separate memory) |\n",
        "| **Uses for CPU-bound Tasks?** |  Inefficient (GIL restricts CPU usage) |Efficient (bypasses GIL, utilizes multiple CPU cores) |\n",
        "| **Uses for I/O-bound Tasks?** | Suitable (threads can handle multiple I/O operations) |  Overhead makes it less ideal |\n",
        "| **Memory Usage** | Shared memory space | Separate memory for each process |\n",
        "| **Speed for Lightweight Tasks** | Faster (low overhead) | Slower (process reaction is expensive) |\n",
        "| **Inter-process Communication** | Complex (shared memory, locks required) | Easier (message passing via ```multiprocessing.Queue```) |\n",
        "| **Best Use Cases** | Networking, file I/O, async tasks | Heavy computation, CPU-bound tasks like machine learning |\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - In backend development and API testing, multithreading can be useful for handling multiple requests efficiently, while multiprocessing is ideal for parallelizing data processing in Flask applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "    - Using logging in a program provides several advantages for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining application reliability. Here's why logging is essential:\n",
        "      1. Helps Debugging and Troubleshooting\n",
        "        - Logs help trace errors without disrupting execution.\n",
        "        - Allows developers to identify where and why failures occur.\n",
        "      2. Tracks Application Behavior\n",
        "        - Provides insights into how the program is running.\n",
        "        - Useful for monitoring API calls, user actions, and system events.\n",
        "      3. Improves Maintainability\n",
        "        - Makes it easier to maintain large applications without excessive print statements.\n",
        "        - Structured logging simplifies debugging for multiple developers.\n",
        "      4. Supports Different Log Levels\n",
        "        - Categorizes logs by severity:\n",
        "        - DEBUG: Detailed internal logs.\n",
        "        - INFO: General execution details.\n",
        "        - WARNING: Potential issues.\n",
        "        - ERROR: Something went wrong.\n",
        "        - CRITICAL: Severe failures.\n",
        "      5. Saves Logs for Auditing and Security\n",
        "        - Logs can be stored in files, databases, or cloud systems.\n",
        "        - Helps detect security threats or suspicious activities.\n",
        "      6. Works Well with Multithreading and Multiprocessing\n",
        "        - Ensures proper logging in concurrent applications without data conflicts.\n",
        "      7. Enhances Performance Monitoring\n",
        "        - Helps optimize performance by tracking execution times.\n",
        "        - Useful in Flask applications for logging API requests and database queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager, which efficiently allocates and deallocates memory for objects. Python uses dynamic memory allocation, meaning memory is managed during runtime. eg: Private Heap memory, Garbage collection, Reference counting, etc.\n",
        "  \n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "  - Here are the basic steps for exception handling in Python:\n",
        "  - Try Block (try) : Write the code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "  - Exception Handling (except) - Catch and handle specific errors.\n",
        "  - Multiple (except) Blocks - Handle different exceptions separately.\n",
        "  - Catch-All Exception (except Exception) - Handle unexpected errors.\n",
        "  - Else Block (else) - Execute if no exceptions occur.\n",
        "  - Finally Block (finally) - Ensure cleanup, like closing files.\n",
        "  - Custom Exceptions (raise) - Define and raise custom errors if needed.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "  try:\n",
        "        num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "        result = 10 / num\n",
        "  except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
        "  except ValueError:\n",
        "        print(\"Invalid input!\")\n",
        "  else:\n",
        "        print(\"No errors occurred.\")\n",
        "  finally:\n",
        "        print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is crucial for ensuring efficient use of system resources.\n",
        "  - It:\n",
        "      - Prevents memory leaks by automatically deallocating unused objects.\n",
        "      - Optimizes performance through memory pooling and garbage collection.\n",
        "      - Handles dynamic memory allocation to support flexible data structures.\n",
        "      - Improves reliability in large-scale applications like Flask-based APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "  - The (try) block detects errors, and the (except) block handles them to prevent program crashes. This ensures smooth execution even when unexpected issues arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collection automatically manages memory by removing unused objects. It uses:\n",
        "      - Reference Counting – Deletes objects when no references remain.\n",
        "      - Cyclic Garbage Collection – Detects circular references and clears them.\n",
        "      - Memory Optimization – Interns small objects and pools memory for efficiency.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "      import gc\n",
        "      gc.collect()  # Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
        "```\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "  - The else block in exception handling runs only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It helps separate normal execution from error handling.\n",
